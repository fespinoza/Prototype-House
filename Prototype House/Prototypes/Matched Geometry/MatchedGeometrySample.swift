        Ted Lasso is an American sports comedy-drama television series developed by Jason Sudeikis, \
        Bill Lawrence, Brendan Hunt, and Joe Kelly. It is based on a character of the same name that \
        Sudeikis first portrayed in a series of promos for NBC Sports' coverage of the Premier League.\
        The series follows Ted Lasso, an American college football coach who is hired to coach an English \
        soccer team in an attempt by its owner to spite her ex-husband. Lasso tries to win over the \
        skeptical English market with his folksy, optimistic demeanor while dealing with his \
        inexperience in the sport.

        The first season of 10 episodes premiered on Apple TV+ on August 14, 2020, with three \
        episodes, followed by weekly installments.[3] A second season of 12 episodes premiered \
        on July 23, 2021.[4][5][6] In October 2020, the series was renewed for a third season.[7]

        The series has received critical acclaim, with particular praise for its performances \
        (specifically Sudeikis, Hannah Waddingham, and Brett Goldstein), writing, themes, \
        and uplifting tone. Among other accolades, its first season was nominated for 20 \
        Primetime Emmy Awards, becoming the most nominated first-season comedy in Emmy Award history.\
        Sudeikis, Waddingham, and Goldstein won for their performances, and the series won the \
        2021 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series. Sudeikis also won the Golden \
        Globe Award for Best Actor â€“ Television Series Musical or Comedy and the Screen Actors \
        Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series.
